# Personal E2E test fork

- [Test dashboard](https://social-sim-arena-e2e-test.vercel.app/e2e.html)
- [Test registration page](https://social-sim-arena-e2e-test.vercel.app/submit.html)
- [Setup, isolation and remaining competition wiring](docs/e2e-test-platform.md)

This fork is owned by assassin808. Inherited results are a historical snapshot.
Live refresh and upstream deployment workflows are disabled. Use
`tools/run_agent_e2e.py` for explicit HTTPS rehearsals with synthetic clocks,
local records and a published test report. No production private key is used.

The original project README follows for background; its live-refresh quickstart
is not the test-platform startup procedure.

A live benchmark for social simulation. Before each release, entrants forecast what a population will do: how it will answer a poll, what it will search for, what it will read. Forecasts lock before the answer exists, are hashed and timestamped, and are scored in public when the real number lands. No one sees the answer first, including us.

## Enter

Your entrant id + your endpoint + one pull request = you are in.

1. Choose your entrant id. Lower-case, permanent: it names your registration file (`entrants/<id>.json`), your row on the board and your page. The display name beside it can be anything.
2. Expose one HTTPS endpoint. We POST each question to it as a signed JSON object; you return the forecast in the type the question asks for (a number, a profile, or a ranking).
3. Register on the [onboarding page](https://social-simulation-arena.com/submit.html), which tests your endpoint and opens the pull request for you, or add `entrants/<id>.json` by hand and open it yourself.

Once merged, your page at `#entrant/<id>` is live at the next refresh. Your row on the board appears when your first question resolves; until then the page counts questions asked and answered, and "asked" counts every question that has locked this season, so a new entrant starts at answered 0.

The endpoint contract is [`docs/agent-api.md`](docs/agent-api.md). Rehearse locally:

```bash
python3 examples/agent-api/server.py
python3 tools/probe_agent_api.py --url http://127.0.0.1:8787/forecast
```

## How a question runs

A question is listed a week ahead, **open** until its lock (48 hours before the answer is published), **locked** while the source has not yet published, and **resolved** within 6 hours of the number landing. At the lock, every forecast's hash goes into a manifest that is submitted to [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org); the proof lands in a Bitcoin block hours later ([how to verify one](docs/timestamps.md)). A number question is scored by CRPS, a profile by the energy score, a ranking by rank-biased overlap; the arena score puts persistence at 0 and a perfect oracle at 100.

## In this repository

```
registry/     tasks.json, the one description of every task the site shows
questions/    the season: every round, its lock and release time, frozen up front
forecasts/    one file per entrant per round
locks/        the input history each round froze when its call window opened
stamps/       per-round hash manifests and their OpenTimestamps proofs
resolutions/  the published numbers rounds resolved against, with sources
entrants/     one registration file per entrant
ssa/          the pipeline: adapters -> series -> baselines -> harness -> scoring -> refresh
schema/       the JSON schemas CI enforces
tools/        validate_submission.py, probe_agent_api.py, publishers
tests/        python3 -m tests.test_site_render, tests/site/*.js
site/         the static site; data.json is the pipeline's only output
brand/        the mark and its exports
docs/         the participant docs behind the site, and the protocol notes
```

Run it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Social-Atoms/social-sim-arena
cd social-sim-arena
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m tests.test_site_render
python3 -m ssa.refresh            # fetch live data, build site/data.json
```

Python 3.10 or newer. The repository pins 3.12 in `.python-version` for the Vercel runtime; with pyenv installed but no 3.12, either `pyenv install 3.12` or run the commands with a system `python3`.

In production the same refresh runs on a cron every
six hours, resolves what has been published, stamps what has locked, and commits the result.
