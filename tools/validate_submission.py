"""Validate forecast submissions. Used by CI on every pull request and
runnable locally:

  python tools/validate_submission.py forecasts/<round_id>/<entrant>.json

Checks, in order:
1. JSON parses and matches schema/forecast.schema.json.
2. round_id matches the directory, entrant matches the file name.
3. The round exists in questions/season0.json.
4. The answer is the shape the round asked for: a scalar round takes a
   `topline`, a profile round takes a `profile` carrying exactly the cells the
   round names, a ranking round takes a `ranking` list of exactly the length it
   names (and, for a fixed-basket round, exactly its items). None substitutes
   for another.
5. The round is still open (now < lock_at). CI runs this at merge time, so
   the commit that lands after the lock fails loudly.
6. Prints the canonical sha256, which the leaderboard and the paper cite.

A `forecasts/_*/` directory holds examples, not submissions. Two of the checks
above cannot apply to one: the directory half of 2, because `_` is not legal in
a round_id, and 5, because an example names a round that has already locked.
Every other check runs. An example is the file a new entrant copies.

Canonical form: JSON with sorted keys and separators (',', ':'), UTF-8.

This file imports nothing from `ssa/`, deliberately: CI runs it on a bare
checkout and it degrades to hand-rolled checks when even jsonschema is absent.
That is why the round-type discriminators below are spelled out here rather than
imported from `ssa/profile_round.py` and `ssa/ranking_round.py`, which own them.
