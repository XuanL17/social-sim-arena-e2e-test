"""The weekly bundle: one file of questions out, one file of answers back.

**Why a bundle rather than a round.** A round is the arena's unit; it is not a
participant's. Season 0's rounds lock on six different weekdays, so a
per-round hand-off asked an external team to track six recurring deadlines and
to file each answer separately -- and a team that missed one of the six had no
way to tell a question they had skipped from one they had never been shown.
`ssa/batches.py` collapsed the six into one Monday 12:00Z deadline, and a
bundle is simply that batch written down: one deadline, every question due at
it, and one reply carrying every answer. Everything here computes the deadline
from `batches.effective_deadline`. **A round's `lock_at` is never a
participant's deadline** -- it is the arena's clock, 0 to 7 days later -- and a
surface that shows it as one is showing a date that is both wrong and late.

**Why all three answer shapes ride in one payload.** A real batch mixes them:
`batch-2026-09-14` is 15 scalar rounds, one 16-cell profile, and one ranking.
Splitting the reply by shape would mean three uploads, three
receipts, and no single moment at which a participant's week is complete --
and, worse, a partial upload would be indistinguishable from a deliberate
abstention. So `normalise` takes one response and returns a verdict *per
round: partial acceptance is a normal, fully-described outcome, not an error.

**Why the shape rules are borrowed, not restated.** Everything a record must
satisfy to survive CI already lives in `tools/validate_submission.py`, which is
the single source of truth the pull-request and lock-audit workflows both shell
out to. Re-implementing those rules here would create the one failure this path
cannot have: a receipt issued for an answer that the validator later rejects,
leaving a participant holding a signed acknowledgement of a forecast that never
landed. So `_checks()` loads that file and calls its own functions, with `fail`
rebound to raise instead of exiting. It imports nothing from `ssa/`, so there
is no cycle, and by construction the intake cannot accept what CI refuses.

**Why the receipt carries the server's clock and both hashes.** The deadline is
decided by when the arena received the payload, never by a timestamp inside it;
a client clock is a field the client controls. The bundle hash pins which
questions were asked -- so a later dispute cannot turn on a manifest that moved
-- and the response hash pins the exact bytes answered, which is also what
makes a re-upload of the same file identifiable as a replay rather than a
second, conflicting submission.

Canonical form is the arena's throughout: `json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True,
separators=(",", ":"))` encoded UTF-8, then sha256. It is what the leaderboard
and the paper cite; it does not change.
