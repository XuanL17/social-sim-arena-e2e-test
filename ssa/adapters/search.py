"""One search index for every entrant, and a record of everything it returned.

  POST https://api.tavily.com/search

**Why the arena runs its own search instead of the vendors' hosted tools.**

Every frontier vendor now ships a server-side search tool, and using them is
the obvious move: no scraper, no key, three lines per protocol. It is also a
confounded experiment. Anthropic's tool searches Anthropic's index, OpenAI's
searches Bing-derived results, Gemini's searches Google. When `claude-opus-web`
beats `gpt-5.6-sol-web`, nothing in the design says whether that is the model
or the index behind it -- and the arena exists to compare models.

Worse, hosted search is a *vendor* capability and not a property of the wire
protocol. Six of fifteen entered models speak OpenAI-compatible chat
completions and serve no search tool at all, so the hosted design could only
ever cover 9 of 15. One index covers all 15 and the comparison means what it
says.

**What is fixed and what the model chooses.** The index, the parameters, the
number of rounds, the number of results and how they are rendered into text are
identical for every entrant. The *queries* are the model's own, because knowing
what to look for is the capability being measured -- that is the whole
difference between this and the `news` condition, where we choose the corpus
and everyone reads the same words.

**Every query and every result is archived, and the archive is the cache.**

    search/cache/<sha256(query+params)>.json   the raw reply, shared across
                                               entrants: overlapping keywords
                                               cost one request, not fifteen
    search/rounds/<round>/<entrant>.json       what this entrant asked, when,
                                               and what came back

One file doing three jobs, the same trick `cache/model_backtest/` already
pulls: it is the cost control, the audit trail, and the only reason a `web`
forecast can be re-derived at all. Search results change minute to minute, so
without the archive this arm would be the single non-reproducible part of a
repository whose headline claim is reproducibility.

**The search happens in the fixed filing window before the participant
deadline and is frozen there.** Not at scoring time, not lazily -- the corpus
is part of what the entrant was shown, and it is committed alongside the
forecast for the same reason `locks/` exists.

**This arm cannot be backtested and the code refuses to try.** A search run
today over a 2025 release retrieves the published answer.
`harness.assert_prospective` raises on the `web` context; nothing here weakens
that.
