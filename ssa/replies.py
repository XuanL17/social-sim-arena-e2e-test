"""Raw provider replies, written the moment they arrive.

A live forecast call is money already spent. Until this module the only thing
that survived one was the *parsed* forecast, which means a reply that came back
malformed -- prose around the JSON, a refusal, a truncated object -- left the
tokens billed and the text gone. So did a run that died between the call and
the commit, and the runner is ephemeral by design: there is nothing to go back
to. On a round whose lock does not wait, the same prompt then gets bought twice.

So every reply is written here before anything tries to parse it, one file per
call:

    replies/<round_id>/<entrant>.<ih>.json
    replies/<round_id>/<entrant>.<ih>.<persona_id>.json     persona panels

`ih` is the same twelve-hex input hash the forecast's notes already carry as
`in=<ih>` -- the hash of (call identity, prompt) from `harness.prompt_hash`. A
reply here and the forecast it produced are therefore joined by a value that is
already published, and two things fall out of that:

  * **Runs resume.** A reply on disk that parses is a forecast nobody has to buy
    again. `harness._ask` looks here before every paid call, so a crash, a bad
    parse or a cancelled workflow costs the tokens once instead of once per
    retry.
  * **The season is auditable.** Temperature is deliberately never set, so a
    rerun does not reproduce and cannot be the reproducibility mechanism. The
    committed raw text is. That claim was already written down in `harness`
    before anything wrote the text down; this directory is what makes it true.

The persona id is in the *filename* because a panel is 192 calls under one
input hash, and one file per respondent is what lets an interrupted panel
resume the 37 it had left rather than re-running all 192.

**Committed, and not rotated.** About 1-2 KB per reply and a few hundred replies
a month across the season's entrants and cells -- single-digit megabytes a
season, against an audit trail that cannot be rebuilt at any price. Nothing here
expires.

That is also the difference from `cache/model_backtest/`, which is this idea for
the backtest and is deliberately *not* committed: a backtest call can always be
re-run for money, while a live round's prompt stops being answerable the moment
the release lands.
